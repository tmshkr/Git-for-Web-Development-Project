Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary and does not start a new line.

and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
display: inline-block;

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default.

Block-level element examples:
<div>
<h1>
<p>

Inline element examples:
<img>
<span>

Inline-block element examples:
<button>

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?

HTML elements are displayed according to the box model, where the element's actual
height and width are determined by the `height`, `width`, `padding`, and `border` properties.

The box-sizing property determines how an element's actual width and height are determined
from the `height`, `width`, `padding`, and `border` properties. The default value is `content-box`,
which determines the actual size of the element according to the formula:

`width` + `padding` + `border` = actual width
`height` + `padding` + `border` = actual height

Alternatively, `border-box` renders the element so that the element's actual size is the same as
its `height` and `width` properties, with the padding and border subtracting from the width and height,
so that the inner content of the box is less than its `width` and `height` properties.
